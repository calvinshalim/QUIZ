a. What are the parent and child classes here?
b. What does the code print out? (Try figuring it out without running it in Python)
c. Which get description method is called when ‘study spell(Confundo())’ is executed? Why?
d. What do we need to do so that ‘print Accio()’ will print the appropriate description (‘This charm summons
an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance’)?
Write down the code that we need to add and/or change.


a. the parent class is "Spell" and the child class is "Accio" and "Confundo"

b.Accio
  Summoning CharmAccio 
  No description
  Confundus CharmConfundo
  Causes the victim to become confused and befuddled

c.The getDescription method defined within the Spell class,Accio class, and Confundo class

d.add another function code below called getDescription(self) 
  class Accio(Spell):
      def __init__(self):
          return Spell.__init__(self, "Accio", "Summoning Charm")

  The code we need to add is :
 
      def getDescription(self):
          return "This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance."
